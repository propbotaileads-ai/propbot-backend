# DoorBot AI — Real Estate Lead Voice Bot

> *"We find leads, call them, qualify them, and book appointments — your agent just shows up."*

---

## What is DoorBot AI?

DoorBot AI is a fully automated real estate lead generation and qualification system. It finds buyer/seller leads from multiple sources, calls them via AI voice, qualifies them, books appointments, and notifies the agent — all automatically, 24/7.

**No manual work. No missed leads. No excuses.**

---

## How It Works

```
Lead comes in (website / Facebook / Google Ads / existing list)
        ↓
Instant email sent to lead — "Talk to [Agent Name] AI"
        ↓
Lead clicks → Bland.ai voice call connects
        ↓
AI qualifies: budget, timeline, city, property type
        ↓
Appointment booked via Calendly
        ↓
Google Sheets updated + Google Calendar blocked
        ↓
Agent gets email: "Hot lead booked! Sarah — $650K — Tuesday 2pm"
```
